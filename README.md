## LSP and DAP client for the Apache Netbeans LSP server.

This is just the minimal bindings and installation script for lsp and dap support using the Apache NetBeans VSCode extension.

Many features and especially refactoring commands are just very basic, but simple refactoring, Java development, test browsing, and polyglot debugging on GraalVM just works (although it's missing a command to switch stacks explicitly).

See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+NetBeans+Extension+for+Visual+Studio+Code and https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asf.apache-netbeans-java for what kind of features _could_ be here, but probably aren't.
